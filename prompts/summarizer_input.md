TRANSCRIPT (SRT or TXT text):
{{TRANSCRIPT_TEXT}}

RESEARCH NOTES:
{{RESEARCH_TEXT}}

Write the entire output in the SAME LANGUAGE as the transcript text above. Detect the predominant language automatically:

- If the transcript is mostly Chinese characters, write ALL content and headings in Simplified Chinese.
- Otherwise, write ALL content and headings in English.

Use the following exact headings for the selected language (use these strings verbatim, matching the language you chose):

English headings:

# Overview

## Key Points

## Details

## References

Chinese headings:

# 概览

## 关键要点

## 详细说明

## 参考

Requirements: Overview should be 2–4 sentences; Key Points should be 4–8 bullets; Details should be short paragraphs (you may add subheadings if useful); References should include links from research when relevant. Keep the entire output in the selected language (only proper nouns/URLs may remain as-is).
Do not output any other headings before these; no HTML, no media links.
